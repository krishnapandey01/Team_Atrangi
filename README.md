# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The physical fitness and health among the work-from-home
folks during the pandemic have been degraded. People have lost
interest to exercise alone in a virtual environment, resulting in
higher obesity levels. Come up with ideas to promote physical
fitness in virtual mode.

# Solution
HEALTH AND FITNESS - Our website provides user with different exercises according to how long they have been working out. The user have to login to access the different exercises. Users can also contact the doctors (one to one)and discuss their diet plan and the exercises they should practise. Our site also provides workout tools and equipment along with medicines at reasonable price and also chatbot which is taking user review..
